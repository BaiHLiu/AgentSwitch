# docs/mesh-v0.md by hand: two throw-away services on this machine, paired through the command line as two Macs would
# be, each using the other. Echo router and executors — no model is called, no agent is started. Not part of the tests.

# Every process here gets an environment built from nothing. A shell inside an AgentSwitch terminal carries the real
# service's AGENTSWITCH_HOME, ports and gate settings; a `serve` that inherited them would run a second service on the
# real state (it marks unfinished tasks as interrupted when it starts). The script stops if either service is not on
# its own throw-away state.
